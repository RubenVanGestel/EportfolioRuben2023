        I am still a student at Thomasmore for now but hopefully soon I will be looking for a job. I have just finished an Internship where I used Angular and Dotnet Core to create a webapp for Wilms. I learned alot during this Internship and started to grow fond of Angular.
        Even tough I enjoy Angular I am still looking for other Languages to use. I want to explore the different things you can do with the different programming languages so realy I am open for anything!

      desc="This project was the most difficult one I have done so far, I had to make an application for HR. The application I was creating was going to digitalize something that was still done mostly on paper. \
        It would also be used to keep a Logbook for each employee. Wilms is a business that wants to give opportunities to their employees to grow as a person and they do this by having regular conversations with their employees. \
        Sadly I dont have the files to show of this project anymore"
